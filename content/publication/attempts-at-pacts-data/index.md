abstract: "A new dataset on attempts to negotiate democratization from 1974 to
  2015, along with names, types, and characteristics of opposition organizations
  that participate in these attempts. The dataset contains variables that
  describe actors` organizational capacity such as share of votes, age,
  membership, along with the data relevant for a country`s perspective for
  democratization: economic development and a type of initial regime. Part of
  the data is retrieved from V-Dem, NAVCO, GWF, and WB datasets. "
