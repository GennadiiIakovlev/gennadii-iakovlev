abstract: "Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the emergence of powerful Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, DepSeek R1, Meta LLAMA, Mistral have
opened new avenues for research in political science. LLMs made methods that were technically
possible but time consuming, such as automated content analysis of political speeches and party
manifestos, accessible. Unimaginable methods – such as synthetic surveys (silicone samples) and
synthetic experiments - are now reality. Some integrations can even generate an entire research paper
from scratch, provided only with a research question and hypothesis. This course focuses on applying
modern LLM-based techniques in political science research and offers a structured overview. In 4
weeks, we will cover the foundations of NLP, explore applications, employ LLM-based analysis, and
learn how to assess the reliability and validity of these methods critically. By the end of the course,
students will be equipped with both the theoretical understanding and practical tools to incorporate the
LLM-driven NLP into their own research on political phenomena."
