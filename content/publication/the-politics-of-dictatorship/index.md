publication_types:
  - "3"
authors:
  - Gennadii Iakovlev
abstract: This course seeks to shed light on the internal organization of
  undemocratic regimes. Why do dictators go to wars? Do they behave differently
  in the realm of international politics?  Who can remove an autocrat from
  power? Are autocrats popular?  What and who creates or undermines autocratic
  rule? Which countries have overgrown dictatorships? What are the possible
  types of dictatorships? Why do some countries hold competitive elections but
  remain autocratic? How can we then distinguish between democracy and
  dictatorship? What autocratic regimes are the most economically prosperous?
